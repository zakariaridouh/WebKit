// Some state is mutated only on one thread, always while holding a lock, yet is read on that same

// other than the owner must hold the lock even to read. Annotate such state with
// WTF_GUARDED_BY_LOCK() as usual, and call assertIsOwnerThread() on the unlocked read path:
//
// struct MyClass {
//     Element* element() const { assertIsOwnerThread(); return m_element.get(); }
//     void setElement(Element* element) { Locker locker { m_lock }; m_element = element; }

//     RefPtr<Element> m_element WTF_GUARDED_BY_LOCK(m_lock);

// The owner may be given as mainThreadLike, or as a ThreadLikeAssertion member for state owned by
// some other thread or work queue.
//
// assertIsOwnerThread() grants only shared, read-only access, so thread safety analysis still
// reports any write that does not hold the lock exclusively. That is what makes this preferable to
// leaving the state unannotated: the "every write holds the lock" half of the invariant stays
// machine-checked, reads from any other thread must still lock, and the unlocked reads become both
// self-documenting and checked at run time.
//
// BlockDirectory has long used this idiom by hand, with assertIsMutatorOrMutatorIsStopped() granting
// shared access to m_bitvectorLock; these helpers generalize it.
//
// A function that calls assertIsOwnerThread() and then takes the lock must release the assertion
// first, by calling releaseOwnerThreadAssertion() below. Otherwise the assertion leaves the lock
// marked as held for the remainder of the scope and the subsequent Locker is reported as acquiring
// a lock that is already held.
